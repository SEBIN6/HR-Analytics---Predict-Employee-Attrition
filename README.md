## 🔍 Project Steps

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Department-wise attrition rates
- Impact of salary bands and promotions
- Correlation between features and attrition

### 2. Classification Modeling
- Built using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall

### 3. Model Explainability
- SHAP values used to explain the influence of features on predictions

### 4. Power BI Dashboard
- Visualizations of key attrition drivers
- Department-level filtering and comparison
- Highlighted insights on high-risk segments
